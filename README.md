# gridmaster
This repository contains code and disk images for running Bruce Rosenblum's early Chinese character bitmap editor. This program, "Gridmaster", was written in AppleSoft BASIC to run on an Apple IIe computer. It provided a graphical editor interface for designing 16x16 bitmaps for Chinese characters (either traditional or simplified) to be used with the Sinotype III program, an early typesetting program for Chinese characters and one of the very first meant to be run on a personal computing system.
